# BSE662-Project
This is a course project as part of the course BSE662A: Decision Making and the Brain. In this project, my project members and I reviewed a paper titled 'Emotion prediction errors guide socially adaptive behavior' by J.Heffner, JY Son and O. FeldmannHall. We described its background, the tasks conducted, results, conclusions, limitations and future prospects. Following this, we attempted to replicate the results of the Ultimatum Game in the paper by developing a simple version on PsychoPy and asking peers to try the game. We also tried to improve on the original study by removing the element of anonymity and recording its effects, as well as using an emotion recognition software to obtain better data.
